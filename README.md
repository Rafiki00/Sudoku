# Sudoku

This is a crude approximation to a sudoku terminal game.
The objective of the program was to create a sudoku puzzle with 20 initial numbers placed and then let the user play it. 
The more I've been thinking about it I have come to realize that it is not enough to generate 10, 20 or 30 random numbers to place in a sudoku grid.
It is possible to place the numbers in a way that the rules are respected, which is what this program does, but it can lead to situations where the puzzle is not solvable.
I have run into situations where the sudoku got to places where I was stuck and no number could be placed at a certain position.
In the future I will use an algorithm to find a complete sudoku.
